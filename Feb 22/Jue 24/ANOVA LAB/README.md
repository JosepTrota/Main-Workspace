| QUESTION | ANSWER |
|---|---|
| **Null hypothesis** | There is no relationship between the power and the etching. |
| **Alternate hypothesis** | There is a relationship between the power and the etching. |
| **Level of significance** | If the p level is under 0,05, we can say with a 95% confidence that the alternate hypothesis is true. /n In this case, it is, so we can refuse the null hypothesis. |
| **Degrees of freedom** | We have three unique power readings, so the degrees of freedom are this number minus one (in this case, two). |
| **Error terms** | Errors or residuals are the segments of scores not accounted for by the analysis. |
| **Total degrees of freedom** | We have 20 observations, so the total DoF is 19 (total readings minus one), as we are looking at sample averages. |

| **CONCLUSIONS** | According to thedata given, there clearly seems to be a relationship between the power and the etching, so to make business decisions taking that into account would be wise |
