## FOR THE DATA USED IN JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Null hypothesis | there is no relationship between the display and the increase of sales. |
| Alternate hypothesis | there is a relationship between the display and the increase of sales. |
| Level of significance | If the p level is under 0,05, we can say with a 95% confidence that the alternate hypothesis is true. In this case, it is, so we can refuse the null hypothesis. |
| Degrees of freedom | we have four unique power readings, so the degrees of freedom are this number minus one (in this case, three). |
| Error terms | Errors or residuals are the segments of scores not accounted for by the analysis. |
| Total degrees of freedom | we have 20 observations, so the total DoF is 19 (total readings minus one), as we are looking at sample averages. |
